The Student Management System is a simple web application built using Java, Spring Boot, and Thymeleaf that allows users to manage student records efficiently. It provides core functionalities such as adding new students, updating existing student details, viewing a list of all students, and deleting records. The application follows the MVC architecture and leverages Spring Boot for backend logic and Thymeleaf for rendering dynamic web pages. It is ideal for learning CRUD operations, Spring Boot fundamentals, and integrating Java with a front-end template engine.
